# V1.1 Post-Phase Ideas

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Source:** User ideas from previous session (restored after memory overflow)

## Ideas Captured

### 1. Unified Portfolio Integration
**Description:** Connect PortfolioRiskCalculator and PositionSync results directly to the EntryWorkflow signals.
**Benefit:** Ensures current portfolio state (delta, position counts) is accurately reflected in entry decisions.
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** EntryWorkflow, PortfolioRiskCalculator, PositionSync

### 2. Configurable Infrastructure
**Description:** Move hardcoded host/port and refresh frequencies to a centralized YAML configuration.
**Benefit:** Improves deployment flexibility and maintainability.
**Complexity:** Low
**Dependencies:** Config system

### 3. Delta Lake Optimization
**Description:** Implement partition-pruning and lazy-loading for Delta Lake reads to ensure long-term stability as data grows.
**Benefit:** Query performance remains fast as data accumulates.
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Delta Lake persistence layer

### 4. Advanced "Rebalance" Action
**Description:** Enhance the DecisionEngine to support a REBALANCE action. Instead of just closing a position when delta hits 0.3, the bot could sell/buy specific legs to "center" the delta back to zero.
**Benefit:** Increases "time in trade" and reduces transaction costs from full exits.
**Complexity:** High
**Dependencies:** DecisionEngine, OrderManager

### 5. Skew-Aware Strike Selection
**Description:** Update StrategySelector to incorporate "Volatility Skew" into strike selection. It could automatically prefer strikes with higher relative IV (selling the expensive side).
**Benefit:** Improves option selling premium by targeting skewed strikes.
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** StrategySelector, option chain data

### 6. Dynamic Profit Targets
**Description:** Instead of a fixed 80% Take Profit, use the EnhancedMarketRegime to adjust targets (e.g., 50% in "High Vol" regimes to exit faster, 90% in "Low Vol").
**Benefit:** Adaptive profit-taking based on market conditions.
**Complexity:** Low
**Dependencies:** EnhancedMarketRegime, exit rules

### 7. Historical/Live Variance Analysis
**Description:** Compare the "Best Strategy" scores predicted at 10:00 AM with the actual P&L realized by 4:00 PM.
**Benefit:** Provides a feedback loop to automatically tune the Strategy Selector's scoring weights.
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** StrategySelector, P&L tracking, analysis tools

## Next Steps

These ideas are candidates for Phase 9 or future work. Priority should be determined by:
1. Business value (ROI)
2. Implementation complexity
3. Dependencies on other work
4. User preference
